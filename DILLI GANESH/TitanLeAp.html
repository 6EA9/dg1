<P><u><b>incorporating training</b></u><br><br>The programme is highly effective and dynamic by constantly incorporating training for newer skills the youth can leverage in the market. Subsequently, to include rural youth within the scope, the programme expanded to include rural livelihoods. The pandemic has been harsh on every industry, business, and skill development. Training shifted from classrooms to the virtual space. Those less privileged struggled to access the requisite gadgets and connectivity</p>
<P><u><b>skill development</b></u><br><br>Titan LeAP program is a youth skill development and livelihood program, supported by CSR of Titan Co. Ltd and implemented by Naandi Foundation. Since its inception in 2017, the LeAP program has impacted  29,535 youth in Tamil Nadu across various districts. While school and college education provides the theoretical knowledge required in the subject, the education system has been unable to keep up with the rapid changes in the necessary skills for gainful employment. Titan LeAP aims to bridge this gap for less privileged learners through a hybrid training model by combining conventional wisdom in skill training and the power of technology.</p>
